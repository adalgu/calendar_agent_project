# Google Calendar Work Schedule Agent Guide

## Introduction

The Google Calendar Work Schedule Agent is a comprehensive system designed to help you efficiently manage your work schedule using Google Calendar, GitHub, and Notion integration. This guide explains how to use the system to optimize your productivity, track project progress, and maintain a balanced workload across different areas of your life.

## System Philosophy

The core philosophy of this system is to provide a structured yet flexible framework for managing your time, with these key principles:

1. **Time Blocking**: Using focused work blocks (45 minutes) with intentional breaks (15 minutes) to maximize productivity
2. **Project Categorization**: Clearly distinguishing between different types of work using project codes
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Using activity tracking from multiple sources to make informed scheduling decisions
4. **Privacy by Design**: Maintaining privacy through anonymized project naming and controlled information sharing
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and adjustment of your schedule based on productivity patterns

## Work Schedule Framework

### Time Structure

- **Regular Hours**: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM (configurable)
- **Lunch Break**: 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM (configurable)
- **Time Slots**: 45 minutes of focused work + 15 minutes break per hour (configurable)

### Project Categories

Projects are categorized and anonymized using codes:

- **MAIN**: Main job tasks
- **SIDE**: Side job projects
- **PORT**: Portfolio preparation
- **FAM**: Family activities

You can customize these categories in the configuration file to match your specific needs.

## System Components

### 1. Google Calendar Integration

The system uses Google Calendar as the primary scheduling interface, allowing you to:

- Create structured work blocks automatically
- Categorize events using project codes
- Track time allocation across different projects
- Set reminders and deadlines

### 2. GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration helps you track your development work by:

- Monitoring commit activity across repositories
- Tracking open issues and pull requests
- Analyzing project progress over time
- Correlating coding activity with scheduled time blocks

### 3. Notion Integration

The Notion integration provides context for your work by:

- Accessing project notes and documentation
- Tracking updates to important pages
- Generating summaries of key information
- Providing reference material for planning sessions

### 4. Logging System

The system maintains detailed logs of:

- Daily schedules and time allocations
- Project activity and progress
- Productivity analysis
- Focus suggestions and priorities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. Google Calendar API credentials
3. GitHub personal access token (optional)
4. Notion API token (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or extract the provided files
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables for API tokens:
   ```
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   export NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_token
   ```
4. Configure your settings in `config.json`

### Basic Usage

The system can be used through command-line interface:

```bash
# Schedule tomorrow's work blocks
python src/work_schedule_agent.py schedule_day

# Get GitHub status
python src/work_schedule_agent.py github_status

# Get recent Notion updates
python src/work_schedule_agent.py notion_updates --days 3

# Analyze productivity
python src/work_schedule_agent.py analyze_productivity --days 7

# Get focus suggestions
python src/work_schedule_agent.py suggest_focus
```

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Planning Session

1. Review your calendar for the day
2. Check GitHub status for ongoing projects
3. Review recent Notion updates
4. Run `suggest_focus` to identify priority areas
5. Adjust your schedule as needed

### Evening Review Session

1. Review completed tasks and achievements
2. Update project status in GitHub and Notion
3. Run `analyze_productivity` to assess your day
4. Prepare initial schedule for tomorrow using `schedule_day`

## Using with LLM Assistants (MCP)

The system is designed to work with Claude or other AI assistants through MCP (Model Context Protocol). Key commands include:

- `/schedule_day`: Plan your daily schedule
- `/update [Project]`: Update project status
- `/adjust [Reason]`: Handle schedule changes
- `/github_status`: Check GitHub project status
- `/notion_updates`: Get recent Notion updates
- `/analyze_productivity`: Get productivity insights
- `/suggest_focus`: Get recommendations for focus areas

## Customization

### Configuration Options

The `config.json` file allows you to customize:

- Work hours and break durations
- Project categories and codes
- GitHub repositories to track
- Notion databases to monitor

### Extending the System

The modular design allows for easy extension:

- Add new data sources by creating additional API modules
- Create custom analysis functions in the main agent
- Develop additional command-line tools for specific needs

## Privacy Considerations

This system is designed with privacy in mind:

- Projects are referenced by code names
- Sensitive details can be omitted from logs
- Calendar events use generic titles with project codes
- API tokens are stored as environment variables, not in code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Rate Limits**: If you encounter rate limiting, reduce the frequency of API calls or implement additional caching
- **Token Expiration**: Refresh your API tokens if you encounter authentication errors
- **Missing Data**: Ensure all required environment variables are set

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs directory for error messages
2. Review the API documentation for the specific service
3. Consult the example code for proper usage patterns

## Advanced Features

### Productivity Analysis

The system can analyze your productivity patterns to help you identify:

- Optimal working hours
- Project time allocation balance
- Correlation between planning and execution
- Progress towards goals

### Automated Scheduling

The scheduling algorithm can automatically:

- Create balanced daily schedules
- Allocate time based on project priorities
- Account for deadlines and milestones
- Suggest adjustments based on past performance

## Conclusion

The Google Calendar Work Schedule Agent provides a powerful framework for managing your time and projects effectively. By integrating your calendar with project tracking tools like GitHub and Notion, it gives you a comprehensive view of your work and helps you make data-driven decisions about how to allocate your time.

Start with the basic functionality and gradually incorporate more advanced features as you become comfortable with the system. Remember that the ultimate goal is to enhance your productivity and work-life balance, so customize the system to fit your specific needs and preferences.
